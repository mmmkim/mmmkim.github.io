<h1>How to Bake Cupcakes</h1>

<p>Baking Pans </p>
<p>A box of cake mix makes 24 to 30 cupcakes in regular-size cupcake pan. There are also pans that have mini, large and jumbo cups. 

Pan Size	   	Cup Size
Mini		1 3/4 x 1 inches
Regular		2 1/2 x 1 1/4 inches
Large		2 3/4 x 1 1/4 inches
Jumbo		3 1/2 x 1 3/4 inches
If you have only one pan and a recipe calls for more cupcakes than your pan will make, just cover and refrigerate the rest of the batter while baking the first batch. Cool the pan about 15 minutes, then bake the rest of the batter, adding 1 to 2 minutes to the bake time. 

An easy way to fill baking cups is to use an ice cream scoop. Use one that measures out 1/3 cup batter when filling regular-size cups. Use one that measures out 2 tablespoons batter when filling mini cups. </p>
