<h1>How to Freeze Cupcakes</h1>

<p>Frosting Tips </p>
<p>Carefully dip tops of cupcake into the frosting, give a slight twist and remove. Finish off with a swirl of a knife if needed. Dip frosted cupcakes into bowls of nuts, colored sugar, sprinkles, or other decors for easy decorating. </p>

<p>How to Store Cupcakes </p>
<p>Cool cupcakes completely before covering to keep tops from becoming sticky (about 30 minutes).
Cover cupcakes that will be frosted later loosely so the tops stay dry. If covered tightly, they become sticky and difficult to frost. 
Store cupcakes with a creamy-type frosting loosely covered with foil, plastic wrap or waxed paper or under a cake safe or inverted bowl. 
Refrigerate cupcakes with whipped cream toppings or cream fillings. 
Frost cupcakes with fluffy frosting on the day they are to be served. 
Freeze cupcakes two to three months, tightly wrapped. 
To prevent frosting on frosted cupcakes from sticking, freeze cupcakes uncovered 1 hour, then insert a toothpick in the top of the cupcake, and tightly wrap. 
Thaw cupcakes in the refrigerator or on the countertop. 
When thawing on the countertop, loosen or remove wrapping to prevent condensation. 
Decorating gel, hard candies and colored sugars do not freeze well because they tend to run during thawing.</p>
